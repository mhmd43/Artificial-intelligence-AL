Artificial intelligence (AI) is a young discipline of sixty years, which is a set of sciences, theories and techniques (including mathematical logic, statistics, probabilities, computational neurobiology, computer science) that aims to imitate the cognitive abilities of a human being. Initiated in the breath of the Second World War, its developments are intimately linked to those of computing and have led computers to perform increasingly complex tasks, which could previously only be delegated to a human.

However, this automation remains far from human intelligence in the strict sense, which makes the name open to criticism by some experts. The ultimate stage of their research (a "strong" AI, i.e. the ability to contextualize very different specialized problems in a totally autonomous way) is absolutely not 
comparable to current

            achievements ("weak" or "moderate" AIs, extremely efficient in their training field). The "strong" AI, which has only yet materialized in science fiction, would require advances in basic research (not just performance improvements) to be able to model the world as a whole.

Since 2010, however, the discipline has experienced a new boom, mainly due to the considerable improvement in the computing power of computers and access to massive quantities of data.

Promises, renewed, and concerns, sometimes fantasized, complicate an objective understanding of the phenomenon. Brief historical reminders can help to situate the discipline and inform current debates.

 Since 2010: a new bloom based on massive data and new computing power

        <p style="font-size: 24px; color: white">
Two factors explain the new boom in the discipline around 2010.

- First of all, access to massive volumes of data. To be able to use algorithms for image classification and cat recognition, for example, it was previously necessary to carry out sampling yourself. Today, a simple search on Google can find millions.

- Then the discovery of the very high efficiency of computer graphics card processors to accelerate the calculation of learning algorithms. The process being very iterative, it could take weeks before 2010 to process the entire sample. The computing power of these cards (capable of more than a thousand billion transactions per second) has enabled considerable progress at a limited financial cost (less than 1000 euros per card).
