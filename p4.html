    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; color:blue">Banking
</h2>
    
    AI in banking is growing faster than you thought! A lot of banks have already adopted AI-based systems to provide customer support, detect anomalies and credit card frauds. An example of this is HDFC Bank.

HDFC Bank has developed an AI-based chatbot called EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant), built by Bengaluru-based Senseforth AI Research.

Since its launch, Eva has addressed over 3 million customer queries, interacted with over half a million unique users, and held over a million conversations. Eva can collect knowledge from thousands of sources and provide simple answers in less than 0.4 seconds.

</h4>   
   When it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are relying on AI. There are many examples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world.

An organization called Cambio Health Care developed a clinical decision support system for stroke prevention that can give the physician a warning when there’s a patient at risk of having a heart stroke.

    Another such example is Coala life which is a company that has a digitalized device that can find cardiac diseases.

Similarly, Aifloo is developing a system for keeping track of how people are doing in nursing homes, home care, etc. The best thing about AI in healthcare is that you don’t even need to develop a new medication. Just by using an existing medication in the right way, you can also save lives.

   Ventures have been relying on computers and data scientists to determine future patterns in the market. Trading mainly depends on the ability to predict the future accurately.

Machines are great at this because they can crunch a huge amount of data in a short span. Machines can also learn to observe patterns in past data and predict how these patterns might repeat in the future.

In the age of ultra-high-frequency trading, financial organizations are turning to AI to improve their stock trading performance and boost profit.

    One day, AI may know more about people than you ever imagined.

Do you want some examples of detected issues that we humans might have overlooked? Well here are 3!

AI can assertively predict if someone is gay or straight based on photographs of their face. A Stanford University study discovered that an algorithm that can correctly identify which men are gay and which are not with 81% accuracy, and 74% accuracy for women.

But that’s not all. Facebook is using artificial intelligence bots that can save the lives of people at risk of committing suicide. As an article by Fast Company explains, the company announced a pilot project in the United States that used AI to proactively identify Facebook posts that could indicate suicidal tendencies. Facebook’s AI technology identified over 100 cases that required intervention.

How is it possible that these kinds of things can be anticipated or predicted with this level of accuracy?

Even if you’re thinking about quitting your current job, AI may know it before Human Resources does. IBM has a solution that uses predictive analytics to identify personnel retention problems. This program can find common factors that cause its staff to quit, creating a quality score for each employee based on the projected probability that they will leave the company soon.

    In 2009, Ira Sages from Businessweek magazine challenged the Director of Quid AI, Bob Goodson, to program a computer to choose 50 companies that no one had heard of and turn them into the most successful startups.

Almost 8 years later, the magazine reviewed the list to see how accurate “Goodson and his machine” were. The results surprised even the creator: Evernote, Spotify, Etsy, Zynga, Palantir, Cloudera, OPOWER, and the list goes on…

20% of the companies the computer chose were valued at a billion dollars.

 Would you trust an investor like this?
